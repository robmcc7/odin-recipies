    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is our favorite banana bread recipe! It’s so good, you’ll want to make two loaves. Your bananas need to be ripe for the best, most flavorful homemade banana bread. It is even better if they are overripe, brown, and speckled. A note on pan size: We use an 8 ½-inch by 4 ½-inch loaf pan; if you only have a 9-inch by 5-inch pan, check for doneness 5 to 10 minutes earlier.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 medium bananas</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Center a rack in the oven and heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter and flour an 8 1/2-inch by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Alternatively, grease the pan, and then line with a sheet of parchment paper
        <li>Place the pan on an insulated baking sheet or two regular baking sheets stacked on the other. This is optional but helps with even baking.</li>   
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bottom of a medium bowl, mash bananas into a chunky paste.</li>
        <li>Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla into the bananas until well blended.</li>
        <li>Switch to a large rubber spatula, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then add the dry ingredients in three parts, stirring until the flour disappears and the batter is smooth. Fold in the nuts and chocolate chips.</li>  
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake 55 to 75 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.</li>  
        <li>After 30 minutes in the oven, check the bread for color. If it looks like it is browning too quickly, loosely cover with aluminum foil.</li>  
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Unmold the bread cool completely.</li>  
    </ol>
